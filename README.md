# 20GamesMsPacMan
A clone of the arcade game Ms. Pac-Man made for the [20 Games Challenge](https://20_games_challenge.gitlab.io/games/pacman/). The goal of this project was to learn how to program an artifical intelligence that can react to the player's actions. State machines as well as component based design were explored in this project. I used the Godot game engine due to it being free and open sorce and C# as it is my personal language of choice when programming.
